### Combining Conditionals
 
Sometimes you will want to do something when more than one condition is true. For example you may only want to grant access to information if both a user name and password match expected values.

The && operator says the expression on the left and the expression on the right must both be true.

For example:
```
if 2 * 2 == 4 && 3 + 3 == 6 {
 // Run this block because both expressions are true!
}
```
*/
/*:
 - experiment:
Write an if statement that uses a && to compare the mood and the time. You should only reply Great! when you're in a good mood and the time is greater than 7. Imagine this is AM! It's hard to be in a "Great!" mood before 7am.
If the time  > 7 and mood is Good then print Great!
*/
var time : Int = 0

if mood == "Good" && time > 7 {
    print ("Great!")
}

/*:
Everyone says it's great when work is over, despite their mood.
In this case we want to reply "Great!" when your mood is "Good" or the time is greater than 17 (5pm).
You can create conditionals that do this like this:

expressionA || expressionB

Here the statement is true when expressionA or expressionB is true.

For example:

```
let pet = "bunny"
if pet == "bunny" || pet == "puppy" {
    print("cute")
}
```
*/
/*:
 - experiment:
 Your goal is to write an if statement that prints "Great!" when mood is "Good" or time >  17.

 Test your work by setting the values for mood and time to different values.

if mood == "Good" || time > 17 {
